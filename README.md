# Marketing-Mix-Model
This repo about marketing mix model. The Marketing Mix Model (MMM) is a statistical analysis that includes multivariate regressions,
sales and marketing values. It provides the answer to the question of "whatever I do, my sales will increase" about the reaction of the
consumer according to the brand values of the companies. I made a model with a dataset that ı found in kaggle.
## About the dataset

### Explanation of the Dataset

    • The dataset was found on the Kaggle platform.
    • There is only one project made on the Kaggle platform with the dataset. In this project, end-to-end analysis was made with the data set. This analysis allows us to get our first impressions of the dataset.
    • The dataset is a coma separatted values, csv file.
    • The dataset contains the sales values of a particular product of a particular brand for 2 years.
    • Each line consists of weekly sales for 2 years.
    • Some of our variables carry the cost values of marketing activities for sales.
    • It is not known what years these two sales were made.
